q_LI(book | the, green) = 1/3 * q_ML(book | the, green)
                        + 1/3 * q_ML(book | green)
                        + 1/3 * q_ML(book)

q_ML(book | the, green) = Count(the, green, book) / Count(the, green)
                        = 1.0

q_ML(book | green) = Count(green, book) / Count(green)
                   = 0.5

q_ML(book) = Count(book) / Count() = 3 / 14

14/42 + 7/42 + 3/42 = 24/42
